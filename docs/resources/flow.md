# davinci_flow (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
//Read all connections - This is a good first call to make
data "davinci_connections" "all" {
  name           = "Flow"
  connector_ids  = "flowConnector"
  environment_id = var.environment_id
}
resource "davinci_connection" "subflow" {
  name           = "Flow"
  connector_id   = "flowConnector"
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  // Forcing dependency on the inital connection provides better consistency when waiting for bootstrap to complete
  depends_on = [data.davinci_connections.all]
}

resource "davinci_flow" "mainflow" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  flow_json      = "{\"customerId\":\"1234\",\"name\":\"mainflow\",\"description\":\"\",\"flowStatus\":\"enabled\",\"createdDate...\"\"connectorIds\":[\"httpConnector\",\"flowConnector\"],\"savedDate\":1662961640542,\"variables\":[]}"
  deploy         = true
  subflows {
    subflow_id   = resource.davinci_flow.subflow.flow_id
    subflow_name = resource.davinci_flow.subflow.flow_name
  }
  connections {
    //Bootstrapped connection
    connection_id   = "867ed4363b2bc21c860085ad2baa817d"
    connection_name = "Http"
  }
  connections {
    connection_id   = davinci_connection.subflow.id
    connection_name = davinci_connection.subflow.name
  }
}

resource "davinci_flow" "subflow" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  flow_json      = file("subflow.json")
  deploy         = true
  connections {
    connection_id   = "867ed4363b2bc21c860085ad2baa817d"
    connection_name = "Http"
  }
  connections {
    connection_id   = davinci_connection.subflow.id
    connection_name = davinci_connection.subflow.name
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) PingOne Environment to import flow into.
- `flow_json` (String, Sensitive) DaVinci Flow in raw json format.

### Optional

- `connections` (Block Set) Connections this flow depends on. flow_json connectionId will be updated to connection_id matching connection_name . (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--connections))
- `deploy` (Boolean) Deploy Flow after import. Flows must be deployed to be used. Defaults to `true`.
- `subflows` (Block Set) Child flows of this resource. Required to keep mapping if flow_json contains subflows. flow_json subflowId will be updated to subflow_id matching subflow_name. Note, subflow will automatically point to latest version (-1). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subflows))
- `variables` (Block Set) Dependent variables of this flow. Required to ensure mapping if flow_json contains variables. flow_json variableId will be updated to variable_id by matching variable_name. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--variables))

### Read-Only

- `flow_id` (String) DaVinci generated identifier after import.
- `flow_name` (String) Computed Flow Name after import. Will match 'name' in flow_json
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--connections"></a>
### Nested Schema for `connections`

Required:

- `connection_id` (String) Connection ID that will be used when flow is imported.
- `connection_name` (String) Connection Name to match when updating flow_json connectionId.


<a id="nestedblock--subflows"></a>
### Nested Schema for `subflows`

Required:

- `subflow_id` (String) Subflow Flow ID that will be used when flow is imported.
- `subflow_name` (String) Subflow Name to match when updating flow_json subflowId.


<a id="nestedblock--variables"></a>
### Nested Schema for `variables`

Required:

- `variable_id` (String) Variable ID that will be used when flow is imported.
- `variable_name` (String) Variable Name to match when updating flow_json variableId.
