# davinci_flow (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
//Read all connections - This is a good first call to make
data "davinci_connections" "all" {
}

resource "davinci_connection" "flow" {
  name           = "Flow"
  connector_id   = "flowConnector"
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  // Forcing dependency on the inital connection provides better consistency when waiting for bootstrap to complete
  depends_on = [data.davinci_connections.all]
}

resource "davinci_flow" "mainflow" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  flow_json      = "{\"customerId\":\"1234\",\"name\":\"mainflow\",\"description\":\"\",\"flowStatus\":\"enabled\",\"createdDate...\"\"connectorIds\":[\"httpConnector\",\"flowConnector\"],\"savedDate\":1662961640542,\"variables\":[]}"
  deploy         = true

  // Dependent subflows are defined in subflows blocks.
  // These should always point to managed subflows
  subflow_link {
    id   = resource.davinci_flow.subflow.id
    name = resource.davinci_flow.subflow.name
  }
  // Dependent connections are defined in conections blocks. 
  // It is best practice to define all connections referenced the flow_json. This prevents a mismatch between the flow_json and the connections

  // This sample references a managed connection
  connection_link {
    id   = davinci_connection.flow.id
    name = davinci_connection.flow.name
  }
  // This sample uses a bootstrapped connection
  connection_link {
    name = "Http"
    // default connection id for the bootstrapped Http connector
    id = "867ed4363b2bc21c860085ad2baa817d"
  }

}

resource "davinci_flow" "subflow" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  flow_json      = file("subflow.json")
  deploy         = true
  connection_link {
    id   = "867ed4363b2bc21c860085ad2baa817d"
    name = "Http"
  }
  connection_link {
    id   = davinci_connection.flow.id
    name = davinci_connection.flow.name
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) PingOne Environment to import flow into.
- `flow_json` (String, Sensitive) DaVinci Flow in raw json format.

### Optional

- `connection_link` (Block Set) Connections this flow depends on. flow_json connectionId will be updated to id matching name . (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--connection_link))
- `deploy` (Boolean) Deploy Flow after import. Flows must be deployed to be used. Defaults to `true`.
- `subflow_link` (Block Set) Child flows of this resource. Required to keep mapping if flow_json contains subflows. flow_json subflowId will be updated to id matching name. Note, subflow will automatically point to latest version (-1). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subflow_link))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) DaVinci generated identifier after import.
- `name` (String) Computed Flow Name after import. Will match 'name' in flow_json

<a id="nestedblock--connection_link"></a>
### Nested Schema for `connection_link`

Required:

- `id` (String) Connection ID that will be used when flow is imported.
- `name` (String) Connection Name to match when updating flow_json connectionId.


<a id="nestedblock--subflow_link"></a>
### Nested Schema for `subflow_link`

Required:

- `id` (String) Subflow Flow ID that will be used when flow is imported.
- `name` (String) Subflow Name to match when updating flow_json subflowId.
