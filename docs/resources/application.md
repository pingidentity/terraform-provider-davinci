# davinci_application (Resource)



~> DaVinci Application Flow Policies are managed as individual resources. Review the migration guidance here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/pingidentity/davinci/latest/docs/guides/migrate-application-flow-policy

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "davinci_application" "my_awesome_application" {
  environment_id = var.pingone_environment_id

  name = "My Awesome Application"

  oauth {
    values {
      allowed_grants                = ["authorizationCode"]
      allowed_scopes                = ["openid", "profile"]
      enabled                       = true
      enforce_signed_request_openid = false
      redirect_uris                 = ["https://auth.pingone.com/0000-0000-000/rp/callback/openid_connect"]
    }
  }
}

resource "davinci_application_flow_policy" "authentication_flow_policy" {
  environment_id = var.pingone_environment_id
  application_id = davinci_application.my_awesome_application.id

  name   = "PingOne - Authentication"
  status = "enabled"

  policy_flow {
    flow_id    = davinci_flow.authentication.id
    version_id = -1
    weight     = 100
  }
}

resource "davinci_application_flow_policy" "registration_flow_policy" {
  environment_id = var.pingone_environment_id
  application_id = davinci_application.my_awesome_application.id

  name   = "PingOne - Authentication"
  status = "enabled"

  policy_flow {
    flow_id    = davinci_flow.authentication.id
    version_id = -1
    weight     = 100
  }

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import davinci_application.example <environment_id>/<davinci_application_id>
```
