```release-note:enhancement
`resource/davinci_flow`: Added the `flow_configuration_json` and `flow_export_json` attributes to the resource.  `flow_configuration_json` is used to compute configuration changes and drift, while `flow_export_json` is used as a record of the resulting flow once imported to the target environment.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `flow_json` parameter does not now represent the flow after import.  It now only represents the flow JSON payload from the source system.  When needing to use the resulting flow after import in the target environment, `flow_export_json` should be used.
```

```release-note:note
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `flow_variables` computed attribute has changed data type.  Previously the attribute was a block type.  Going forward, the attribute is nested set type.  There are no changes expected to HCL to use the new data type.
```

`resource/davinci_variable`: Fixed inability to update the environment ID once created (resource now requires replacement).
