```

```release-note:bug
`resource/davinci_application_flow_policy`: Fixed error when specifying a flow policy without any `policy_flow` blocks.  The `policy_flow` block is now a required field.
```

```release-note:bug

`resource/davinci_flow`: Corrected panic errors on flow drift calculation and connection/subflow re-mapping.
```

```release-note:note
`resource/davinci_flow`: Updated warning messages when subflows and connectors are left unmapped.  Going forward, all subflows and connections in a flow should be mapped using the `connection_link` and `subflow_link` parameters.

```release-note:enhancement
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `name` parameter is now an optional field, to be able to override the name of the flow on import.
```

```release-note:note
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `deploy` parameter is now deprecated.  Deployment on import and update is now implicit.  This parameter will be removed in the next major release.

```

```release-note:enhancement
`resource/davinci_flow`: Added the `flow_configuration_json` and `flow_export_json` attributes to the resource.  `flow_configuration_json` is used to compute configuration changes and drift, while `flow_export_json` is used as a record of the resulting flow once imported to the target environment.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `flow_json` parameter does not now represent the flow after import.  It now only represents the flow JSON payload from the source system.  When needing to use the resulting flow after import in the target environment, `flow_export_json` should be used.
```

```release-note:note
`resource/davinci_flow`: The `flow_variables` computed attribute has changed data type.  Previously the attribute was a block type.  Going forward, the attribute is nested set type.  There are no changes expected to HCL to use the new data type.
```

```release-note:bug
`resource/davinci_variable`: Fixed inability to update the environment ID once created (resource now requires replacement).
