- This is a Terraform project. Whenever a change is made to the schema of a resource or data source, a changelog entry must be created according to the instructions at `contributing/changelog-process.md`
- There should be one changelog entry block per change, in the same file, and the file should be named after the PR number (if the PR number is not known, use `tbc`)
- The changelog entry text should have the resource or data source as the prefix, in markdown backticks. For example "`resource/pingone_flow`: Added new thing."
- The changelog entry should be in past tense, something has been added, changed or removed, and should be correctly punctuated.
- Every change should be tested. Only impacted tests should be run. An example command is `TF_ACC=1 go test -v -timeout 1200s -run ^TestAccForm_ github.com/pingidentity/terraform-provider-davinci/internal/service/davinci`.  In this case, the `TestAccForm_` is the prefix or name of the impacted test to run.
- If using 1Password for secrets management, the test command should include `op run --`, as in this example: `TF_ACC=1 op run -- go test -v -timeout 1200s -run ^TestAccForm_ github.com/pingidentity/terraform-provider-davinci/internal/service/davinci`
- If a Terraform schema is changed, use `make generate` to regenerate the Terraform documentation, `make lint` to check linting.
