# DaVinci Provider

The "davinci" provider allows operators to manage PingOne DaVinci infrastructure
as code. This provider can be used along with the [PingOne provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/pingidentity/pingone/latest/docs)
to stand up fully orchestrated PingOne IAM Experiences.

## Getting Started

This provider will authenticate an API client via username and password of an Identity in PingOne to configure to the DaVinci environment.

### PingOne SSO

To manage multiple PingOne DaVinci environments with the same credentials, identify and treat one user in one environment as a service account. This is commonly a user in the `Administrators` environment. The environment in which the user exists must default to the `Single_Factor` Authentication Policy. Thus, it may be more appropriate to create this user in an alternate environment.

This user must: 
- Be in a PingOne Environment with DaVinci enabled. 
  - The PingOne environment must default to the  `Single_Factor` Authentication Policy
- Have at least the following roles in the environment in which it exists:
  - `Environment Admin` for it's own environment
  - `Identity Data Admin` for it's own environment
  - `Organization Admin` at the organization level. 
- For each additional DaVinci environment that needs SSO access, give this user the `Identity Data Admin` and `Environment Admin` roles for that environment.  See the **[Full deployment example with a PingOne environment](#full-deployment-example-with-a-pingone-environment)** example below for how to do this in HCL.

## Example Usage

### Authenticate using static credentials

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

### Authenticate using credentials as environment variables

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-env.tf" }}

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-env.sh") }}

### Full deployment example with a PingOne environment
The following assumes that the DaVinci admin user has been provided the `Environment Admin` and `Identity Data Admin` roles scoped to the PingOne environment containing the Identity, and the `Organization Admin` role scoped to the organization.
