# DaVinci Provider

The "davinci" provider allows operators to manage PingOne DaVinci infrastructure as code. This provider can be used along with the [PingOne provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/pingidentity/pingone/latest/docs) to stand up fully orchestrated PingOne IAM Experiences.

## Getting Started

To get started using the PingOne and DaVinci Terraform providers, first you'll need an active PingOne cloud subscription with the DaVinci service license additions.  Get instant access with a [PingOne trial account](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/try-ping.html), or read more about Ping Identity at [pingidentity.com](https://www.pingidentity.com).

Further information about enabing the DaVinci service license can be found [here](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/#the-pingone-davinci-service-license).

### Configure PingOne and DaVinci for Terraform access

For detailed instructions on how to prepare PingOne and DaVinci for Terraform access, see the [DaVinci provider getting started guide](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/#configure-pingone-for-terraform-access) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate how to configure the DaVinci provider. 

If the PingOne Environment and Permissions are managed in:
  - **separate module** - use [static credentials](#authenticate-using-static-credentials) or [environment variable credentials](#authenticate-using-credentials-as-environment-variables).
  - **same module as davinci configuration** - use the [full deployment example](#full-deployment-example-with-a-pingone-environment).

For a more thorough example on how to set up PingOne for DaVinci API authentication see [getting started](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/)

### Authenticate using static credentials

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

### Authenticate using credentials as environment variables

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-env.tf" }}

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-env.sh") }}

### Full deployment example with a PingOne environment

The following assumes that the PingOne worker app has been provided the `DaVinci Admin` role scoped to the PingOne environment containing the Identity, and the `Organization Admin` role scoped to the organization.

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-with-pingone.tf" }}

### Custom User Agent information

The DaVinci provider allows custom information to be appended to the default user agent string (that includes Terraform provider version information) by setting the `DAVINCI_TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable.  This can be useful when troubleshooting issues with Ping Identity Support, or adding context to HTTP requests.
